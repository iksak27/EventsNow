        'Starting as a new manager can be tough, and definitely out of your comfort zone. And what many managers are finding is that what made them a top performer before is not working anymore.

They don’t want to lose the respect of their team. And it leaves you feeling lost and stressed by yourself. With little help and all the responsibility to make things work in record time.',

Known for her site specific and monolithic sculptures, her haunting installations and her skill as a sculptor, unbeknownst to many, Louise Bourgeois\’ oeuvre also includes a collection of literally thousands of drawings. Made over the span of her seventy year career, Bourgeois\’ drawings are perhaps the most immediate of the artists\’s works - often created late at night whilst suffering from insomnia, or as a kind of creative diary, the drawings explore universal and deeply emotional themes, all through the medium of doodling. This class will explore Louise Bourgeois\’ obsession with Drawing through a series of mindful drawing exercises, working both from imagination, some of Bourgeois\’ own writings, and from her oeuvre, expect a series of unusual therapeutic exercises designed to make use of drawing as a cathartic tool.',
